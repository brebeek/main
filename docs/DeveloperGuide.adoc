== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Typee_UML-Architecture.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`
, `StartWindow`, `GameWindow`, `PlayerInformation`, `GameBody`, `MovingWords` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `HistoryManager`.
It extends `EngagementList` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `historyList` and `versionPointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `HistoryManager#saveState()` -- Saves the current engagement list state in its history.
* `HistoryManager#undo()` -- Restores the previous engagement list state from its history.
* `HistoryManager#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone engagement list state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveEngagementList()`, `Model#undoEngagementList()` and `Model#redoEngagementList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `HistoryManager` will be initialized with the initial engagement list state, and the `versionPointer` pointing to that single engagement list state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the engagement list. The `delete` command calls `Model#saveEngagementList()`, causing the modified state of the engagement list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `historyList`, and the `versionPointer` is shifted to the newly inserted engagement list state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 3. The user executes `add d/meeting ...` to add a new engagement. The `add` command also calls `Model#saveEngagementList()`, causing another modified engagement list state to be saved into the `historyList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[width="450", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveEngagementList()`, so the engagement list state will not be saved into the `historyList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoEngagementList()`, which will shift the `versionPointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous engagement list state, and restores the engagement list to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[width="450", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the `versionPointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial engagement list state, then there are no previous engagement list states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#hasNoUndoableCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[width="750", align="center"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoEngagementList()`, which shifts the `versionPointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the engagement list to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `versionPointer` is at index `historyList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest engagement list state, then there are no undone engagement list states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#hasNoRedoableCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `sort start ascending`. Commands that do not modify the engagement list, such as `sort`, will usually not call `Model#saveEngagementList()`, `Model#undoEngagementList()` or `Model#redoEngagementList()`. Thus, the `historyList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveEngagementList()`. Since the `versionPointer` is not pointing at the end of the `historyList`, all engagement list states after the `versionPointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add d/meeting ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[width="450", align="center"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[width="190", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire engagement list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of engagement list states.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `historyList` and `engagementList`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `jdeveloper.history.HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Tab Switch Feature
Tab switch feature is a type of Command that allows users to switch to respective windows for using different features in the system. System UI structure is generally divided into 2 parts;

==== Implementation Structure

.TabCommand Implementation Class Diagram
image::TabCommandClassDiagram.png[]

1. `MainWindow` which contains necessary text input for `Command` inputs and output display for displaying the `CommandResult`
2. Window component, which is a type of `VBox`, that acts as a container for other different UI windows.
3. Tab Menu List, which displays the name of the tab/menus, which has respective separate UI windows. User has to use a specific `Command`; `TabCommand` in order to switch the window to another window.
* Upon first startup of the system, by system default, system will display the `EngagementList` window.
4. New Ui Model class `Tab` is implemented to contain the respective fxml controller classes in a OOP manner. Below is the class diagram for `Tab` class

[.text-center]
.Tab Class Diagram
image::TabClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

From figure 9, MainWindow will have an additional method `fetchTabInformation(tabName)`. After the parser executes the `TabCommand`, it will return a CommandResult with `Tab` property.
The method will compare the `Tab` in `CommandResult` and once there is a matching result, the method will load the respective fxml file in the MainWindow to display the respective feature window.
Below is the basic activity diagram of fetchTabInformation method

.fetchTabInformation method Activity Diagram
image::fetchTabInformationActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]

=== Engagement Report Generation
This feature allows user to generate a pre-selected engagement in to a report and save it as a document file. The document file will be created in a .pdf format.

==== Implementation Structure

.PdfCommand Implementation Class Diagram
image::PdfCommandClassDiagram.png[]

The feature will be implemented as an additional type of Command; `PdfCommand`

* Proposed syntax of the PdfCommand is as follow: `pdf i/[engagementList_index] to/[Person] from/[Person]`.

Util class `PdfUtil` will be implemented for handling all pdf document creation related methods.

.PdfUtil Class Diagram
image::PdfUtilClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

PdfUtil class will be implemented under `util` package and it will be able to deliver few essential features
that are necessary for document creation.

** Able to generate a full report document based on the `Engagement` as input.
** Use different templates for each other types of `Engagement` such as `Appointment`, `Interview` and `Meeting`. Document template will follow general email format:
Receiver, Content contained in a table, Sender and signature with address and company logo (Refer to Figure 12).
To fulfill the document format, `Report` class needs to be implemented in order to model all necessary properties that has to be in the document. It 3 following properties;

***  `engagement`: specific engagement information to include in the document
*** `to`: A `Person` who is receiving the document
*** `from`: A `Person` who is either a receptionist or a secretary who is sending the document.

==== UI Design
`ReportWindow` will be the UI container which helps the user to interact using `PdfCommand`. UI will consist of 2 main scrollable panes; Engagement list with index numbers,
and the directory explorer for `reports/` as a item list.

===== UI Components & Features
Table below explains the components that are included in the `ReportWindow` with its purpose and features.

.Report Window UI Components
[%header, cols=4*]
|===
|
|UI Component Type
|Feature
|Purpose

| `EngagementList`
| Scrollable Stack Pane
| Displays the sorted engagement list
| To guide user to help recognize the list index number that the user wants to generate document from.

| `File_Explorer`
| Scrollable Stack Pane
|
1. Displays the list of document generated previously and stored under the directory `reports/`.

2. Each list item is clickable with a MouseClick action of opening the document.
| To allow user to manage documents more time efficiently.
|===


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Calendar Window

The calendar window provides a visual representation of stored engagements over a monthly period.
Users can choose to change the month being displayed and also open scrolling text windows which
show more detailed descriptions of the stored engagements for a particular day.

==== Implementation Structure
.Structure of the Calendar Window
image::CalendarWindowClassDiagram.png[]

The `CalendarWindow` is part of the `MainWindow`. Specifically, it is one possible `Tab` which can be
displayed. The `CalendarWindow` class and any of its associated UI components can be found under the `com.typee.ui.calendar` package.

.CalendarWindow Initialization Sequence Diagram
image::CalendarWindowSequenceDiagram.png[]

The controller is set after constructing the `CalendarWindow` because there were some issues with
using constructors containing at least one argument.

| To allow the user to view the animation of the moving words in a continuous manner.

| `MovingWords`
| Scrollable Stack Pane
| Displays the individual word.
| To allow user to know the next word to type.
|===

=== Sort feature
==== Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `EngagementComparator`.
The `EngagementComparator` is an enum class that implements Java Comparator<Engagement> and specifies the comparing logic of 8 different orders, namely `START_TIME`, `START_TIME_REVERSE`, `END_TIME`, `END_TIME_REVERSE`, `ALPHABETICAL`, `ALPHABETICAL_REVERSE`, `PRIORITY`, and `PRIORITY_REVERSE`.
Each positive sequence comparator compares two `Engagements` with the field specified within its name in ascending order, and `_REVERSE` comparators compare in descending order.

Additionaly, the `Model` interface is modified to support the following methods:

* `Model#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)` -- Sets the designated comparator in model.
* `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()` -- Executes the sorting method with the `currentComparator` in model to sort the internal list.
* `Model#getSortedEngagementList()` -- Returns the current internal engagement list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList`.

These operations are implemented in the `ModelManager` class as `ModelManager#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)`, `ModelManager#updateSortedEngagementList()` and `ModelManager#getSortedEngagementList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `currentComparator` will be initialized as `null`.

image::SortListState0.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 2. The user executes `sort priority ascending` command to sort the engagement list in ascending order of priority. The `sort` command calls `Model#setComparator()`, causing the `currentComparator` in ModelManager to assume the value `EngagementComparator#PRIORITY`. The command then calls `Model#updateSortedEngagementList` to execute the sorting.

image::SortListState1.png[width="450", align="center"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="750", align="center"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `SortCommand` and `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 3. The user executes `add d/meeting ... p/high` to add a new engagement. The `add` command also calls `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()` with `currentComparator`, causing the execution of sorting after the new engagement is added to the list, to preserve the current ordering.

image::SortListState2.png[width="450", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentComparator` assumes the initial value `null` when `Model#updateSortedEngagementList` is called, the method will simply catch the `NullPointerException` thrown by `java.object.requireNonNull` which will essentially abort the attempt to sort with an empty catch block. The initial chronological order is preserved in this case.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the engagement list or alter the order of the list, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)`, or `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()`. Thus, the internal `ObservableList` remains unchanged.

image::SortListState3.png[width="450", align="center"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::SortUpdateActivityDiagram.png[width="190", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sort executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the `List.sort(Comparator<T>)` function to sort the list.
** Pros: Has trivial support for features that updates the predicate of `FilteredList`, like `Find`.
** Cons: There is a need to sort the list each time a command that modifies the elements of the list is executed, which may result in performance issues in case the list size is large.
* **Alternative 2:** Replace the `FilteredList` in `ModelManager` with a `SortedList`.
** Pros: Sorting the list is more intuitive, and the ordering of the engagements is automatically preserved whenever a command that modifies the list elements is executed.
** Cons: Features like `find` command may lose functionality and needs extra modification.
