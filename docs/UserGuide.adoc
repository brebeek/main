== Introduction

Typee is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing appointments. It is designed for secretaries and receptionists who prefer to work with a CLI while still enjoying the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Head over to <<Quick Start>> to see how to get the application running!

== Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2.  Download the latest `typee.jar` (coming soon).
3.  Copy the file to the folder that you want to use as the home folder for your Typee application.
4.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
5. Type a command in the text box and press `Enter` to execute it.

.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all appointments.
* **`add`** `d/Meeting on Monday` : adds an appointment with the description `Meeting on Monday` to the appointment manager.
* **`delete`** `3` : deletes the 3rd appointment shown in the current list.
