== Introduction

Typee is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing engagements such as appointments, interviews and meetings.
It is designed for secretaries and receptionists who prefer to work with a CLI while still enjoying the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). Head over to <<Quick Start>> to see how to get the application running!

== Quick Start

2. Download the latest `typee.jar`.
3. Copy the file to the folder that you want to use as the home folder for your Typee application.
4. Enter the command `java -jar typee.jar` on your terminal to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
5. Type a command in the text box and press `Enter` to execute it.

=== Changing to calendar view : `tab calendar`
Changes the current view to the calendar view, which displays engagements inside a calendar. The calendar displays the number of
engagements per day. More commands are provided for interaction with the calendar window.

Format: `tab calendar`

.Calendar view for October 2019
image::calendar-view.png[width="450"]

=== Displaying the list of engagements for a specified date (calendar view only): `calendar opendisplay`
Opens a separate window displaying the list of engagements for the specified date. Only one such window is allowed per date.
This means that nothing will happen if this command is used with a date which already has an open engagements list window.

Format: `calendar opendisplay [date]`. The date must follow a DD/MM/YYYY format.

If this command is used to open an engagement list window using a date from another month, the calendar's view will switch to
display that specified month. This command can be used to quickly switch to another month which is not immediately before or
after the currently displayed month.

All engagement list windows will be closed if something is done to change the displayed calendar month
(e.g. using the `calendar nextmonth` command). This includes using this command as in the above paragraph.

Example: The calendar is currently displaying information for October 2019 and there are engagement list windows open for three dates
in the display. If `calendar opendisplay 11/11/2019` is entered into the input box, then all three engagement list windows will be closed.
The calendar's display then switches to November 2019 and the engagement list window for 11 November 2019 is opened up.

This command does not work if the application is in another tab (view) or the specified date is invalid.

.Engagement list for 01/11/2019
image::calendar-open-display.png[width="450"]
{empty} +
After entering `calendar opendisplay 01/11/2019` into the input box while in calendar view for October 2019, the
above window opens up. The date 01/11/2019 is still valid because it is displayed in the calendar view for October
2019, albeit at the end of the grid.

Alternatively, you may click on any of the individual cells within the calendar window to open the engagement list
for that date.

=== Changing the calendar display to the next month (calendar view only): `calendar nextmonth`
Changes the calendar view to the month following the currently displayed one. This command does not work if the
application is in another tab.

Format: `calendar nextmonth`

.Changing to the next month from October 2019
image::calendar-next-month.png[width="450"]
{empty} +
Alternatively, you may click on the blue button with the right arrow next to the calendar's month title
to change the display to the next month.

This command closes any open engagement windows from the current month before updating the display to the next month.

=== Changing the calendar display to the previous month (calendar view only): `calendar previousmonth`
Changes the calendar view to the month prior to the currently displayed one. This command does not work if the
application is in another tab.

Format: `calendar previousmonth`

.Changing to the previous month from October 2019
image::calendar-previous-month.png[width="450"]
{empty} +
Alternatively, you may click on the blue button with the left arrow next to the calendar's month title
to change the display to the previous month.

This command closes any open engagement windows from the current month before updating the display to the previous month.

=== Typing game : `tab game`
Changes the current window to the start window with a kbd:[Start] button.

.Start window of the game
image::StartWindow.png[width="450"]
Click the kbd:[Start] button to open the game in a new window.

.Game window
image::GameWindow.png[width="450"]

There are moving words that you can type in order to score points. Once you correctly type the specified word,
the word disappears and the increase in points is reflected in the player information panel in the game window.
[NOTE]
After typing a word, remember to press kbd:[Enter] to clear the text area which is located at the bottom of the screen.


When you fail to type the word before the moving word reaches the bottom of screen, the decrease in health points
is reflected in the player information panel in the game window.
After the health points reaches zero, `GAME OVER` is displayed as shown below.

.Sample game play when game is over
image::GameOver.png[width="450"]

Once the game is over, you can manually close the application by clicking the kbd:[x] on the top right hand corner of the window.
If you want to play the game again, click the kbd:[Start] button shown in the Start window.

=== Generating a PDF file of engagement : `pdf`
Pdf Command allows user to create a document of selected engagement in a given format of document template.
Document template can be customised based on the customers's requirements, however, default document format will be in an eamil format,
where the user can set who the user is going to send this document to inform an engagement. +

Format: `pdf i/[index] to/[receiver] from/[sender]` +

For example, if the user wants to create a document of an engagement, which has a list index of 1, which can by observed in `engagement` window.
User sets the sender as `John`, which is the user's name, and sets `receiver` as `Harry`. Hence, user enters `pdf i/1 to/Harry from/John` to generate the document.

If the user does not want to keep the document, instead of directing the actual directory in the local stystem, user can simply click the red `x` button, next to the refresh
button to delete the selected document list item. Once system displays the popup message to confirm the user's decision, user will click the `OK` button to confirm deletion. Delete function will only available when user has pre-selected the document list item and the selected item must be a .pdf form, not directory.
Below is the screenshot after user clicks the delete button.
