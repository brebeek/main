== PROJECT: Typee


== Overview

We are a group of 5 NUS Computer Science students involved in enhancing a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop
application that manages addresses for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an appointment
management application called *_Typee_*.


*_Typee_* is a CLI application that allows secretaries and receptionists to better schedule and
manage appointments. Receptionists and secretaries possess one of the fastest typing speeds and would get increased
productivity using the CLI-based *_Typee_*. The CLI application boosts productivity by having a comprehensive
appointment management system with calendar view, pdf report generation, as well as a typing game.

=== Features Contributed to Project

==== Major enhancement: added `tab game`
** [red]#*_What_* -# The game feature is a simple typing game where users score points whenever a word, such as
 `fire`, `something`, is correctly typed.

** [red]#*_Why_* -# The game feature is a utility feature that allows the user to practice and exercise their typing skill,
which is an essential skill for secretaries and receptionists. The game-like environment uses a points system and has the
advantage of keeping users incentivized, entertained and motivated to improve their skills.

** [red]#*_Highlights_* -#
*** This enhancement can be triggered using the `Start` button following `tab game` command.
This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands.
In-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to...
The implementation was also challenging becauseâ€¦
